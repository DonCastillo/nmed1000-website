                    <p>It was dark. I could not move the lower part of my body. My waist and leg were pinned by the large debris that used to be the wall of my room. Everything went black after that huge explosion. It was as if the world crumbled.</p>
                    <p>It has been four months since the uprising began. In the beginning, we all thought that it was going to be a peaceful protest. I remember that almost half of the city’s population went to the Municipal Hall with their placards and signages voicing out their condemnation on the looming passage of a law that might curtail the rights of the people. The government did not listen to the outcry of the people and passed the law. That was when the people fought back.</p>
                    <p>It all started with the noise. Everyone who passed by the Municipal Hall honked their cars to show their support to protesters in the street. The protest was then replaced by violence incited by the police when they couldn’t handle the uncontrollable situations. I saw in the news the thick smoke that blanketed the City Plaza after the police throw a couple of tear gas hoping that it would stop the protesters and pacify the situation. It did not work.</p>
                    <p>On the other side of the city where I live, the people there resorted to a nonviolent protest. Some of my religious neighbors gathered the residents in the area to hold prayer vigils. After the prayers, they distributed these colorful flowers picked from the church’s backyard. They said that the flowers symbolize hope that the violence in the city would end.</p>
                    <p>The protests did not stop. It has gotten worse every single day. Police arrested everyone who didn’t follow the law. Any form of protests became illegal. “They are rebels,” the government said. Surveillance cameras were installed in every corner of the street. The city, which used to be a haven of democracy, became a dystopian society.</p>
                    <p>In the fourth month of protest, this happened.</p>
                    <p>I couldn’t remember how it happened. It was four in the morning when I heard a commotion outside my window. I kept my eyes shut but my ears were listening. “This could be another group of rebels planning to do something illegal,” I thought. The next time I opened my eyes, I found myself trapped under the debris.</p>
                    <p>I gathered my strength to remove myself from the debris. I could feel the warmth of my blood flowing from my forehead. After several moments, I finally freed myself.</p>
                    <p>Anywhere I looked around, I could see nothing but destroyed houses. All I could hear was the crying of the people. It was chaotic. I walked down the street hoping to get help. When I reached the church, I could see the piles of bodies being loaded in the truck. I reached my hands and began to faint when I heard a gunshot. I fell down the ground and felt the searing pain in my stomach. I was shot. The last thing I saw before everything went dark again was the colorful flower lying on the ground beside me. The flower became blurry as my eyes were filled with tears. It’s like looking at it through a kaleidoscope. The flower that used to symbolize hope and end of violence now symbolizes the end of my life.</p>
